# session-keys-example-dapp

This is a demo dapp for implementing Argent session keys.

### Session keys

Working with Argent X and Argent Webwallet

Both modes have hardcoded values and works on SEPOLIA.
This example dapp send an ETH amount from an address to itself.

### Offchain session keys

Working only with Argent Webwallet, require a whitelist for test and production.
Otherwise can run only on localhost

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
